CascadeV4 is a high-level dynamic programming language, revamped for the 4th time to make more extensive use of OOP. To run any file, execute main.py.

Lexer: Program File -> Token Stream

Parser: Token Stream -> AST

Interpreter: AST > Execution

Planning on adding environments to handle global and local scope, as well as for functions. Maybe add OOP or maths libraries as a stretch.
